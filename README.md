# Lutron Lighting Innovation Competition 2023 
Boston University SILab Lutron Lighting Innovation Competition 2023

Have fun and make the light shine with your imagination!

Each team must design and construct their coolest, most innovative lighting design project. Projects will be judged on: Creativity and Originality, Engineering Sophistication, and Aesthetic Appeal. Any combination of mechanical, electrical and computer engineering will prove useful toward these categories. Projects may (but need not) include complex mechanical design, circuitry, or microcontroller programming to produce a final project of these qualities. Requirements for amount of light produced, application of product, or overall purpose are intentionally left ambiguous to allow for a wide spectrum of resulting projects.
